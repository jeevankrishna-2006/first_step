        content: "Teja Sajja grabbed the attention of moviegoers across the country with Hanu-Man. The film was released during the Sankranthi 2024 season and went on to become a huge blockbuster, not just in Telugu but in Hindi as well. After the gigantic success of Hanu-Man, Teja Sajja teamed up with cinematographer-turned-director, Karthik Gattamneni, for yet another underdog turned superhero film, Mirai. Manchu Manoj played the antagonist role and Ritika Nayak played the lead actress role in the film. The film generated enough buzz with the first look poster and the expectations increased further with the teaser and trailer. With the expectations riding sky-high, the film was released in theatres today. Did Teja Sajja deliver yet another commercial blockbuster with a superhero film? Did the director, Karthik Gattamneni, finally deliver a commercial success, after struggling to score a hit with his first two films, Surya vs Surya and Eagle? How did Manchu Manoj do in the antagonist role? Did Ritika Nayak continue her success streak with her second film, after the success of her debut film, Ashoka Vanamlo Arjuna Kalyanam? How did Shriya Saran do in the role of a mother? More importantly, did the production house, People Media Factory, score a resounding success, after the not-so-successful last few films? Letâ€™s figure it out with a detailed analysis.",
